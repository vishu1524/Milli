						Burbnas, a mobile check-in app, was the origin of Instagram in San Francisco. After noticing it
						was too similar to Foursquare, Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger decided to refocus their app on
						photo-sharing, which had become a popular feature among its users. A mashup of “instant camera”
						and “telegram,” Instagram became the new name.

					<p>
						WhatsApp was founded in 2004 by former Yahoo! employees Brian Acton and Jan Koum. Both Acton and
						Koum were early adopters of the iPhone and realized the then newly-created App Store was about
						to create a whole new industry.

						The pair refined their idea for WhatsApp during weekly pizza and movie nights with friends. Koum
						in particular envisioned an app where a list of names in an address book could have individual
						statuses.For example, one contact might be on a call while another had a low battery. Pizza and
						movie night host Alex Fishman then introduced Koum and Acton to iPhone developer Igor
						Solomennikov – a Russian developer Fishman had found on RentACoder.com. Eager to begin, Koum
						incorporated WhatsApp in February 2009.

						Google Chrome is a cross-platform web browser developed by Google. It was first released in 2008
						for Microsoft Windows, built with free software components from Apple WebKit and Mozilla
						Firefox. It was later ported to Linux, macOS, iOS, and Android, where it is the default
						browser. The browser is also the main component of ChromeOS, where it serves as the platform
						for web applications.

						Most of Chrome's source code comes from Google's free and open-source software project Chromium,
						but Chrome is licensed as proprietary freeware. WebKit was the original rendering engine,
						but Google eventually forked it to create the Blink engine; all Chrome variants except iOS
						now use Blink.

						As of October 2021, StatCounter estimates that Chrome has a 68% worldwide browser market share
						(after peaking at 72.38% in November 2018) on personal computers (PC), is most used on
						tablets (having surpassed Safari), and is also dominant on smartphones, and at 65%
						across all platforms combined. Because of this success, Google has expanded the "Chrome"
						brand name to other products: ChromeOS, Chromecast, Chromebook, Chromebit, Chromebox, and
						Chromebase.
